Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Bienn. I am a Yale graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I love creating tools that provide value to its users, whether it be a tool to [create audio loops](https://looper.bienn.dev) or [determining whether a speech excerpt is synthesized](https://github.com/biennviquiera/speech-classifier). I previously interned at ContractSafe and Meta where I have been able to gain useful skills in both small and large environments.
